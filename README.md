The dataset consists of sales information from an online store covering the entire Brazilian territory, operating in various departments through multiple sales channels.
Business assumptions:
1 - Due to an observed error in the registration system, some purchases do not have the state (UF) information. For these, it should be considered that they belong to the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS).
2 - The cost of a product/purchase cannot be higher than its added value of shipping.

Metrics to be analyzed:
1 - Departments with the most sales: Analyzing sales data allows us to identify the most popular departments. This enables adjusting the store's sales strategies to align with customer preferences.
2 - Average price with shipping by department: Helps understand the average spending in each department, identifying the most profitable departments and assisting in adjusting product pricing to achieve the expected results.
3 - Monthly sales quantity: Through this metric, possible seasonalities in sales can be analyzed, aiding in the development of marketing campaigns for each period.
4 - Average customer income by sales channel: Identifies the target audience for the sales channel, refining the sales funnel and marketing efforts.
5 - Average age of customers by brand: Identifies the profile of consumers, adjusting the sales sector to better serve each audience.
